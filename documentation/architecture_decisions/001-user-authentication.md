# ADR 001: User Authentication Approach

## Context

The FindMrWhite application needs to support user registration and authentication. We need to decide on an approach that is secure and maintainable.

## Decision

We will implement a session-based authentication system using:

- MongoDB for user data storage
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Express sessions for maintaining login state

User registration will require:

- Unique username
- Valid email address
- Password (minimum 8 characters)
- Password confirmation

## Consequences

- Passwords will be securely stored using bcrypt hashing
- We'll need to implement proper session management
- This approach is simpler than token-based auth for our needs
- Database will need to scale with user accounts
- Security is enhanced by validating password strength and uniqueness
