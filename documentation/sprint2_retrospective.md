# Sprint 2: Game Foundation

## Completed User Stories
A total of 5 stories were planned.
4 stories were delivered. 
1 was moved to sprint 3.

## What worked well (Succesfully Delivered stories): 
# stories by Erick Chauke
- As a player, I want to vote on who I think is the undercover player and see eliminated players' roles so I can strategize effectively during gameplay.

# Stories by Tokelo Mphahlele
- The User is able to logout after game sessions by tapping on the logout button.

# Stories by Alungile Rawuka
- As a player, I want to describe my secret word without revealing it so that I don't get caught if I am the undercover.

# Stories by Mzudumile Kaizer
- As a player, I want to see real-time changes(votes, eliminated, etc..) so that i can stay engaged

## Deployment
- Successful Azure deployment

## Challenges Encountered
- there was a challenge succesfully integrating the user stories because they were closely tied which meant group members sometimes had to wait for otheres to implement a prior functionality.


## Action
- Break User stories into sub-issues to keep track of the progress.
- Try to identify dependency between user stories as early as possible to avoid delays

## To come
- Implement functionality so players can see who was eliminated during  a round.
- The game ends when only two players remain and a winner is announced
- Players can see their player stats for their latest games
- Players can view a leaderboard and compare their results to other players.
- Players can invite other players to join a game through an invite button.
- Players are able to view a game tour/tutorial of the app and rules on how to play
- Administrator can access a log from the website which captures all action taken by the app's users.
