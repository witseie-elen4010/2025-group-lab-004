# Coding Standards

## JavaScript Style

- We'll follow StandardJS conventions (no semicolons, 2-space indentation)
- Use descriptive variable names (camelCase for variables and functions)
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task

## Naming Conventions

- Files: kebab-case (e.g., user-service.js)
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., GameManager)
- Component IDs: kebab-case (e.g., game-container)
- Database fields: camelCase

## Code Organization

- Separate concerns into different modules
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible
- Comment complex logic
